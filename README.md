Hello :)

This is the code repository to the first programming assignment of **CS6910 - FUNdamentals of Deep Learning**.

**Objective**: To write our own backpropagation code and keep track of your experiments using wandb.ai. The experiments will further be used to analyze the best hyperparameter settings and investigate them further to understand their applicability for other similar datasets.

**Input**: Fashion Mnist dataset

**Output**: The prediction accuracy for the validation set


**Inside CS6910_Assignment1 folder** - you will find **instructions to run the notebook** and the link to the **wandb report**.
